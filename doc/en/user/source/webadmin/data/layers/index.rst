.. warning:: Document status: **Draft**

In GeoServer, the term **layer** refers to a collection of raster or vector data that contains geographic features. All layers have a source of data, known as a store. Vector layers are also known as featuretypes and raster layers are also known as coverages.

In the :guilabel:`Layers` section of the :ref:`web_admin`, you can view and edit layers, add a new layer, or delete an existing layer.
