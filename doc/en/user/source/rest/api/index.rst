REST Configuration API reference
================================

This section contains a full reference to the GeoServer REST configuration API.

.. todo:: This page contains a number of representations saved as plain text. They have not been updated. How to verify that these are still up-to-date? Or how best to update them? Or perhaps we want to remove them instead? 

.. todo:: Need to verify if this list is exahustive. Some entries, like "/fonts", are hidden (why?), so there may be others.
