Security
========

This section details the security subsystem in GeoServer, which is based on `Spring Security <http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/>`_.

As of GeoServer 2.2.0, the security subsystem has been completely reengineered, allowing for much more secure and configurable operations.
