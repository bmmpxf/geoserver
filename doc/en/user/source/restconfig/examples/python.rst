Python
======

We are looking for volunteers to flesh out this section with examples.  But anyone looking to do python scripting of the GeoServer REST config API should use `gsconfig.py <https://github.com/dwins/gsconfig.py/wiki>`_.  It is quite capable, and used in production as part of `GeoNode <http://geonode.org>`_, so examples can be found in that codebase.  It just currently lacks documentation and examples.
