RESTful Configuration
=====================

GeoServer provides a `RESTful <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_ interface through which clients can configure an instance through simple HTTP calls. Using the REST interface, clients can programatically configure GeoServer without the need to use the :ref:`web_admin`.

To learn more about the GeoServer REST interface, proceed to the :ref:`rest_overview` section. For details about its API and some hand-on examples, proceed to the :ref:`rest_config_api_ref` and :ref:`rest_config_examples` sections.
